    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br />
      They said,
      <q class="everybody"
        >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
        unfortunate.</q
      >
      The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> <br />
      The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
      in the evening everybody came back and said,
      <q class="everybody">Oh, isn’t that lucky.</q> <br />
      What a great turn of events.
      <q class="everybody"> now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,
      <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
      riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
      <q class="everybody">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer
      responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br />
      The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
      into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br />
      Again all the neighbors came around and said,
      <q class="everybody">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
      <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q><br />
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">
      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
      complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
      happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
      consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
      consequences of good fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys,
      <br />but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out
      of it...
